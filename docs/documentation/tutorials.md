OpenL Tablets Tutorials
-----------------------

Series of tutorials designed to familiarize you with OpenL Tablets step-by-step, taking you from simple features and concepts to more complex ones. These tutorials were designed to be somewhat interactive to make you familiar with OpenL Tablets and basic editing actions. Each Tutorial is located in a separate project named Tutorial\[N\] - ..., where N is tutorial number. It is highly recommended that you do these tutorials in the natural order. Each tutorial contains set of working examples. Good luck and have fun!

### Tutorial 1 - Introduction to Decision Tables

This tutorial will familiarize you with Decision Tables as main and widely used type of OpenL Tablets components.. In addition to tutorial steps lets read cell comments. Make sure that running of Rules in WebStudio will produce the desired results, otherwise you probably missed something.

### Tutorial 2 - Introduction to Data Tables

This tutorial demonstrates how to enter relational data into OpenL Tablets. Data can be used everywhere within OpenL Tablets and your Java application as familiar Java Arrays. Data Tables can consist of Java classes or OpenL Datatypes. The important feature of OpenL Data Tables is that data becomes available to OpenL Tablets or Java application without writing a single line of code.

### Tutorial 3 - More Advanced Decision and Data Tables

This tutorial will teach you more advanced features of decision and data tables. You will learn how to enter array data, use merged cells to structure tables with array elements, link multiple data tables into Object Graph using foreign keys-like approach, enter aggregate data objects as a single table, enter formulas to decision table cells.

### Tutorial 4 - Introduction to Column Match Tables

This tutorial will give you short introduction and examples how to use Column Match Table types. You will learn 3 algorithms of Column Match tables: MATCH, SCORE and WEIGHTED, depending on which you might map different groups of conditions to a single return value, calculate weighted ratings or total scores for a set of conditions.

### Tutorial 5 - Introduction to TBasic Tables

This tutorial will introduce you with a completely new table type - Tbasic - which will allow you to implement different algorithms with rather complex logic such as loops, checks, switching execution flow control / steps order, breaking loops. The usage of TBasic tables we'll demonstrate on examples.

### Tutorial 6 - Introduction to Spreadsheet Tables

This tutorial will introduce you with the next new type of OpenL Tablets - Spreadsheet Table - which will allow you to make lots of different calculations and return matrix of results. Two ways of Spreadsheet tables processing will be demonstrated on examples.

### Tutorial 7 - Introduction to Table Properties

This tutorial will demonstrate advanced usage of OpenL Tablets rules when several rule sets (Rules Tables) are used simultaneously, in other words - when rules are versioned. To achive this, table properties are introduced.

### Tutorial 8 - Introduction to Smart Rules and Smart Lookup Tables

This tutorial will tell you about the main features of smart rules and how they differ from simple rules. You will learn about the structure of smart rules, data that can be used as input, supported types of ranges, True/False conditions in smart rules, type of data that can be returned, and multiple values return.

### Example 1 - Bank Rating

This example is designed to calculate the final value of the Limit for transactions that are subject to credit risk from bank-counterparties. The Limit is calculated according to the country of a bank-counterparty, total assets of the bank, its rating group, credit ratings assigned by The Big Three credit rating agencies and the maximum limit allowed on a bank-counterparty.

### Example 2 - Corporate Rating

This example is designed to assign Corporate Rating to a company according to its financial statements (Financial Rating) and estimated risk of collaboration with the company (Risk of Work with Corporate). The main aspect of the Rating is to identify creditworthiness of the company.

### Example 3 - Auto Policy Calculation

This example represents business rules module defined in UServ Business Rules Model 2005 (see this specification in **doc** file). This is simple example of application of OpenL Tablets rules. In this example you will encounter most of table types: Decision tables, Data tables, Datatypes, Spreadsheets, Method and Properties tables. Also there you can see an example of tests for rules located in the separate module.
