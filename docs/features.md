## User Friendly Engine

### Business Oriented

Create rules in easy table format similar to usual business documents. Highlight, colorize and strengthen your rules. Use any styles and formats you need.

### Simple Rules Definition Language

The majority of rules wonâ€™t require any complex constructions. All common cases are assumed by default. Just indicate what data to use and sometimes what calculations to do.

### Errors Discovery

The type safe approach uncovers the majority of errors while authoring. An error reporting with links to the exact cell with a mistake in it makes fixes easy.

### High Performance

Optimized execution engine ensures rules performance and productivity.
