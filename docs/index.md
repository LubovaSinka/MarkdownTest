Easy Business Rules
-------------------

**OpenL Tablets** targets the infamous gap between _business requirements_ (rules and policies) and software implementation.

Designed to be straightforward and intuitive for **_business people,_** OpenL Tablets made its rules representation impressively close to documents usually created by business (it intends business requirements, etc.).



Users can focus on logic as all data, syntax and typing errors are checked while they write rules. Convenient tools help to ensure rules integrity while further editing.

One-click deployment of rules as efficient, scalable and standardized services for _**micro-services based**_ implementations makes business logic simple to consume in OMNI-channel usages and applications.

For Java developers, OpenL Tablets provides many additonal rich usage scenarios in which all rules and business data can be embedded in applications or customized for seamless integration with other frameworks and technologies.

OpenL Tablets is open source and free to use.
